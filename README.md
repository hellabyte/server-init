Server Init
-----------

Initializes servers to my liking:

1. Set up basic file tree in home directory: ~/.local
2. Clone github hellabyte/bash_colors and installs it
3. Clone github hellabyte/myconfig and unforced install it
4. Source possibly new bashrc
5. Check if tmux exists, installs libevent and ncurses then tmux
   to ~/.local otherwise
6. Check if anaconda is the python manager, installs to ~/.local/opt
   otherwise
7. With option will install open mpi
